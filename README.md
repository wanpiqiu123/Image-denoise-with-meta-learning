# Image denoise with meta learning

This is the course project for CS386 : **"Digital Image Processing"** in SJTU, in which we are required to implement codes for image denoising. I applied Reptile on contemporary methods and changed the network structures a little bit. The main idea of this project originates from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00111) and *guassian noise*, *poisson noise* and *real world noise* are tested in this project.
